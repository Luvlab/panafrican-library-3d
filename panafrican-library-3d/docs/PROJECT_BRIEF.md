## Deliverables

1. ✅ Interactive 3D HTML viewer (single-file deployment)
2. ✅ Deployed web application on Vercel
3. ✅ Source code on GitHub
4. ✅ Documentation (README, design notes)

## Technical Requirements

- Browser-based (no installation required)
- Mobile-responsive
- Fast loading
- Works offline after initial load

## Rooms Included

| Room | Name | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| 5202 | Special Special | Sound library, listening space |
| 5203 | Reading Room | Main reading area, book displays |

**NOT included:** Room 204, Three Star, or any other adjacent spaces

## Timeline

- Initial development: Complete
- Floor plan corrections: Complete
- Vestibule addition: Complete
- Room renaming (5202/5203): Complete
- Documentation: Complete
- Deployment: In progress

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Room Numbers:** Changed from 202/203 to 5202/5203 (corrected misread)
2. **Room 5202 Name:** "Special Special" (not "Sound Library")
3. **Entry Vestibule:** Added to Room 5202 per floor plan
4. **Window Orientation:** Windows on SOUTH (exterior), doors on NORTH (corridor)
5. **Connecting Door:** Between rooms on shared wall
